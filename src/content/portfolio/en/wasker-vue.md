# Project Overview

Wasker Vue is a personal website theme designed for developers who demand the ultimate experience. It is not just a gallery for showcasing work, but a space for expressing technical thoughts and design aesthetics.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Immersive Experience
Adopting dark mode as the default tone, combined with exquisite typography and micro-interactions, providing visitors with an immersive reading and browsing experience.

### 2. Knowledge Graph
Introducing a Force-Directed Graph to visualize the connections between articles and projects. This is not only cool but also a non-linear way of knowledge navigation, allowing visitors to discover serendipity during exploration.

### 3. "Less is More"
In this project, we exercised extreme restraint in the use of decorative elements. Every pixel and every line of code has its meaning. We believe that good content itself is the best design.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: Utilizing Composition API for smoother logic reuse.
- **Vite**: Blazing fast dev server and build tool.
- **D3.js / 3d-force-graph**: Powering the underlying 3D knowledge graph.
- **Markdown**: All content is written in Markdown, no database required, deploy and go.
