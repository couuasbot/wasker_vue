Building a 3D graph requires a solid foundation. We started our journey in [[galaxy-introduction]] and decided to use a combination of Vue 3 and Three.js.

Key components include:
- [Three.js Basics](/blog/threejs-basics) for 3D rendering.
- 3d-force-graph for the physics simulation.
- Vue 3 for the UI overlay.

Performance is critical, which is why we use sprites for nodes.
