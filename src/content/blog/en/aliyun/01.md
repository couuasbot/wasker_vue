> I have an Alibaba Cloud server with the following configuration. I want to make the most of this server. Please provide a resource usage plan (setup plan) that is perfectly adapted to this configuration:
>
> Region: Central China 1 (Wuhan - Local Region)
>
> Package Configuration: 2-core vCPU | 2 GB RAM | 40 GB ESSD | 200 Mbps Peak Bandwidth | BGP Public Network Line Type | 1 IPv4 Fixed Public IP Address

Since you've chosen these four directions, it indicates your core requirements are: **High bandwidth utilization, cross-device collaboration, and automated O&M (Operations and Maintenance)**.

Given the 2GB RAM limitation, we need to leverage the **containerized management advantages of 1Panel** to finely allocate resources. Here is the **1Panel landing and implementation guide** for these four scenarios:


### 1. FRP (Internal Network Penetration): Moving your home computer to the public internet

**Core Value:** Your cloud server has a public IP and 200M bandwidth, making it the perfect "springboard" for intranet penetration.

* **Deployment:**
* Install **FRP Server (frps)** from the 1Panel App Store.
* **Scenario Simulation:** If you have a high-performance gaming PC at home without a public IP, you can run the FRP client at home. Through this server, you can access your home computer directly using a phone or tablet while away.


* **Bandwidth Advantage:** Common free penetration services offer only 1-5Mbps, but you now have **200Mbps**. This can even support remote streaming of AAA titles from your home (Steam Link / Moonlight).

### 2. RustDesk: Self-hosted "Lightning Fast" Remote Desktop Relay

**Core Value:** Say goodbye to the speed limits and fees of Sunlogin or TeamViewer. Achieve 60 FPS seamless remote access using your 200Mbps bandwidth.

* **Deployment:** Search for **RustDesk Server** in the 1Panel App Store.
* **Key Configuration:**
* It includes two containers: `hbbs` (ID server) and `hbbr` (relay server).
* **Firewall Configuration (Crucial):** You must open TCP ports `21115, 21116, 21117, 21118, 21119` and UDP port `21116` in both the Alibaba Cloud security group and the 1Panel firewall.


* **How to Use:** Enter this server's public IP and the key on your PC and the controlled device. You'll experience what "instant connection" truly means.

### 3. AList: Creating an All-in-One "Cloud Drive Aggregation Hub"

**Core Value:** Turn your 200Mbps bandwidth server into a powerful transfer station.

* **Deployment:** Search for **AList** in the 1Panel App Store for one-click installation.
* **Configuration Recommendations:**
* **Mount Cloud Drives:** Mount Alibaba Cloud Drive, Quark, Baidu Netdisk, etc.
* **Enable WebDAV:** Once enabled, you can connect to the server's IP directly on your home PC or TV (using PotPlayer or Infuse). With 200Mbps bandwidth, playing 4K movies from cloud drives is as smooth as playing local files.
* **Offline Download:** AList supports integration with Aria2. You can use the server as a download machine, and once finished, it can automatically transfer files to your cloud drive.


### 4. Qinglong Panel: Automated Script Manager

**Core Value:** Rewarding tasks, automatic check-ins, and scheduled tasks.

* **Deployment:** Search for **Qinglong** in the 1Panel App Store to install.
* **Memory Optimization (for 2GB RAM):**
* The Qinglong panel consumes RAM when running scripts. It's recommended not to run dozens of tasks simultaneously.
* **Staggered Scheduling:** Modify Cron expressions so different scripts run at different times, avoiding the "top of the hour" (e.g., 0:00) when all tasks might start at once and cause the system to freeze.
* **Lean Dependencies:** Only install necessary Node.js or Python dependency packages.


### 🚀 Pitfall Prevention and Resource Optimization Tips (Must Read)

With your configuration, running all four applications will come very close to the 2GB RAM limit. Please ensure you perform the following:

1. **Prioritize Setting Up Swap (Virtual Memory):**
* In 1Panel's "Host" -> "Tools", set up a **2048MB - 4096MB** Swap file. This ensures the server won't crash if the Qinglong panel runs a large script and causes a momentary memory spike.


2. **Firewall Policy (Security First):**
* **RustDesk:** Ports 21115-21119 as mentioned above.
* **FRP:** Default port 7000.
* **AList:** Default port 5244.
* **Qinglong:** Default port 5700.
* *Recommendation:* Only open the ports you need in the 1Panel firewall and keep all others closed.


3. **Traffic Warning:**
* Although it's 200Mbps peak bandwidth, confirm if your plan is "fixed bandwidth" or "pay-as-you-go". If it's pay-as-you-go, running high-traffic video via AList will incur significant costs. Monitor traffic consumption on the 1Panel monitoring page.


4. **Data Backup:**
* You don't have an extra data disk; the 40GB is all on the system disk. Set up a "Scheduled Task" in 1Panel to periodically back up AList and Qinglong configuration databases to your cloud drive to prevent data loss in case of a system crash.
