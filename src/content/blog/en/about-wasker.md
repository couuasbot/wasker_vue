# 📜 The Evolution of Wasker

> This is a story of self-iteration and technical advancement. [Wasker](../../portfolio/en/wasker%20series/wasker_template.md) has evolved from a simple HTML static page into a modern Content Management System integrated with 3D visuals, AI interaction, and a global distribution gateway.

## 1️⃣ wasker_static_template (Vanilla Static Template)
> **The Start**: Returning to the essence of web development, pursuing ultimate loading speed and pure interactive experiences.

🔗 **Open Source**: [github.com/couuas/wasker](https://github.com/couuas/wasker)

*   **Tech Stack**: `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript (ES6)`, `Bootstrap Grid`, `GSAP`, `Swup.js`, `Swiper.js`, `Isotope`, `Fancybox`.
*   **Core Features**:
    *   **Seamless Navigation**: Uses `Swup.js` for logical single-page navigation, smooth and natural.
    *   **High-Performance Animation**: Integrated `GSAP` and `ScrollTrigger` for delicate parallax scrolling and entrance effects.

## 2️⃣ wasker_vue_template (Vue 3 Driven Template)
> **The Advancement**: Transitioning from "writing pages" to "building applications," introducing component-based development and Markdown-driven (CMS) philosophy.

🔗 **Open Source**: [github.com/couuas/wasker](https://github.com/couuas/wasker/tree/main/wasker_vue_template)

*   **Tech Stack**: `Vue 3 (Composition API)`, `Vite`, `Pinia`, `GSAP`, `Markdown-it`, `Highlight.js`.

    *   **Auto-Routing**: Automatically analyzes and generates page routes based on the `src/content/` directory structure.
    *   **Efficient State Management**: Uses `Pinia` to manage global application state, resulting in a cleaner architecture.
